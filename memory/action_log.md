# Action Log (Full Audit Trail)

**Purpose:** Uncapped log of every agent run. Auto-trimmed to last 100 runs when it exceeds 500KB.
**Format:** Each entry shows timestamp, model, budget, steps taken, and full reasoning.

**NOTE (2026-08-10, Round 2 reset):** This log was reset again after deploying the
JSON-mode fix. The previous run produced a `[PARSE FALLBACK]` because Gemini
emitted prose ("The user wants me to...") before the JSON. The new fix forces
JSON-only output via `responseMimeType: "application/json"` at the API level,
so this should not recur. Old entries removed to avoid biasing the LLM.
